To ensure the repuation of this project in the newly emerging FinTech world, we will incorporate actual economic and financial data that illustrates actual racial wealth gap, measured through indicators such as income, employment rates, home ownership, etc. We seek to implement more sophisticated technical analysis to predict future market trends, that coupled with deepened understanding of the correlation that exists between Market Conditions and this Wealth Gap, can provide our users to make better informed decisions. To enhance our ability to deliver, we have developed interactive visualizations and educational content to accomplish our group's ultimate goal to promote  financial literacy among underprivileged and minority communities.
